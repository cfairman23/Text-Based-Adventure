# Text-Based-Adventure

This is the basic structure for a sophisticated text-based adventure, or choose your own adventure app. The added bonus in this app is that the user not only makes choices, but has attributes that change depending on the choices that they make. For example, there is the "strength" attribute, which increases if the user goes to the gym over the library. Additionally, the attributes and the current screen that the user is looking at all get saved locally to the phone so that the user's attributes and place in the adventure are never lost, even if they close the app. This is all thanks to UserDefaults. This small structure can easily be adapted to a text-based adventure of any size, with the programmer adding additional storyboards to hide clutter. I am currently working on a novel-length app myself, which is saved in a private repo. Hopefully, I'll release it on the app store one day.
